    hashmap and equals, if changesdo (immutable class of employee)
•	Consider a class Person with two attributes -
    String name and List<String> degrees. How will you make this class immutable.

        •	Getter method


•	We have a Parent class with 2 methods walk and run.
    We have a child class which overrides both the methods.
    Both child class methods just call their respective Super implementation.
    Parent class run method calls walk().
    class Parent Parent p = new Child(); p.run(); Tell the order in which each method is called

•	Given a List of integers (List<Integer>),
    write code in Java 8 style to get the sum of the squares
    of all the odd numbers in the array.

    int sum = IntStream.of(A).filter(e->e%2==1).map(a->a*a).sum();

•	Given an array of n integers and a number k,
    find the pairs of numbers in the array such that the difference between the pair is k.
    Find the optimal solution with and without extra storage

  if(arr[i]-arr[j]==k||
    arr[j]-arr[i]==k){
        count++;



•	Write a function to count the number of unique digits in a number


        while(num>0){
            digits.add(num%10);
            num/=10;
        }
        return digits.size();
